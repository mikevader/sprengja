# README #

Readme for *sprengja*. This game is far far away cousin from the very very old QBasic game gorillas. *sprengja* is Icelandic and stands for explosion because if you remove the gorillas form the original game the only thing that remains are: *sprengja*

### The Game ###
The current game mechanic is quite simple. You have two players in one 2D field and each with a mortar. The players try in turns to hit each other. As soon as one player is hit the other wins and the game ends!


### Open Questions for the camp ###
We have some open question on how we wanna work together in the camp 2014. I think the topic is more or less set but were we wanna go is quite open and how we wanna get there. So the following open list are questions (and answers) we should address before the camp:

* Repository: Which repository and workflow do we use during the camp for sharing our code base?
* Common solution or five experiments? Do we want to consolidate our solution or has everybody its own solution?
* Devices: What devices brings everybody along? It would be great if we have a big assortment :-) The bigger the better!
* AppStores: Do we have preferences on the AppStores? Or who wants to have a closer look at which AppStore?
* What beer do we drink? (We should have at least one common goal we can actually achieve ;-))
* Remote or just local: Do we want to have remote multiplayer function with server side or do we concentrate on just the client?


### Where can I get/play it? ###
It is meant to be a mobile device game ... but for now you can play it on (http://sprengja.herokuapp.com)

### Run the server locally ###
- Ensure that bower is installed
- `npm install`
- `node server.js` or with auto reload `nodemon server.js`  (`npm install -g nodemon`)

### Libraries ###
